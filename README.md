Analyzing video data for microfluidic adhesion experiments using image processing on MATLAB.  

The setup includes a microvasculature bed of Laminin (Ln) protein and sickle cell patients blood is flowed through the microchannels at ramping flow rates. Under flow conditions, the adhered cells experience forces of the order of 10-1000 pN. The cells either directly detach or first roll down the bed (due to constant breaking and forming of protein-ligand bonds) and then detach. The cropped gif file of how the cells is shown below:

To get different parameters out of a video of RBCs (sickled + healthy) rolling, like number, velocity, type of motion,...
